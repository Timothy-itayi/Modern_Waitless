Modern Waitless

Introduction

Modern Waitless is a full-stack restaurant ordering application inspired by the original Waitless project, which was developed as a final project during my programming bootcamp. The original version was built as a responsive web application designed for restaurant order management. This modern iteration improves upon the original by utilizing newer technologies, optimizing performance, and leveraging cost-effective deployment strategies.

Original Waitless Project

Tech Stack:

Frontend: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS

Backend: Node.js, Knex.js, PostgreSQL

Testing: Jest

Deployment: Initially deployed on Heroku

Features:

User authentication (basic email/password, no third-party integration)

Database-driven menu categorization

Shopping cart functionality (add/remove items)

Order creation and processing

Responsive web design for mobile and desktop users

Why Modern Waitless?

After completing the bootcamp the group split up and we were all personally responsible for deploying Waitless after a period of time when it was deployed for a short time. Initially, I chose Heroku because that was how it was deployed before and it was a lot easier to use at the time, but due to high costs, I decided to create a modern, self-sufficient version that is more efficient and cost-effective.
